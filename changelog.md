* v0.10.0.1
    - Fix build issues caused by removed symbols in dependencies
    - Adjust `text` bounds

* v0.10.0.0 2021-01-25
    - Require MPD version 0.19 or later.
    - Breaking: `list` now takes a `Query` instead of a `Maybe Artist`, and lists the requested tag of songs matching the query.
      Migrate by changing `list $Tag Nothing` to `list $Tag mempty` and `list Album (Just "someone")` to `list Album (Artist =? "someone")`.
    - Breaking: song ranges now expressed with the `Range` datatype rather than `(Position,Position)`, allowing for partial ranges (see documentation).
      Migrate by changing `(x,y)` to `Range x y`.
    - Breaking: add missing `Metadata` constructors: `AlbumSort`, `OriginalDate`, `Conductor`, `Work`, `Grouping`, `Label`, `MUSICBRAINZ_WORKID`.
    - Breaking: add missing `Subsystem` constructors: `PartitionS`, `NeighborS`, `MountS`.
    - Breaking: add missing `ReplayGainMode` constructor: `AutoMode`.
    - Breaking: move `toggle` from `N.M.C.Extensions` to `N.M.(C|A).PlaybackControl`.
    - Fix: `idle` now properly detects the following subsystems: `PartitionS`, `StickerS`, `SubscriptionS`, `MessageS`, `NeighborS`, `MountS`.
    - Remove deprecated functions: `(<&>)` (use `<>` instead), `updateId`, `addList`, `playlistAddList`.
    - Add monadic versions of `searchAdd` and `searchAddPl` commands (previously only had applicative versions)
    - Fix: The server setting "single: oneshot" now sets `stSingle` to `True` rather than erroring out.

      Implemented through the added combinators `/=?`, `%?`, `~?`, `/~?`, `qNot`, `qModSince`, `qFile`, `qBase`.
